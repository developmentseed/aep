## Introduction

Access to electricity remains a global development challenge with about 759 million people lacking access to electricity in 2019. Inadequate electricity services also pose a major impediment to reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where 570 million people and tens of millions of small and medium enterprises had no access to electricity.

For this large share of the world population, welfare, health, and economic development are negatively impacted: children are unable to study at night; businesses, markets and health clinics have constrained operating hours and struggle to offer basic services; and productivity and competitiveness of African firms is impeded, to name just a few. Addressing the energy access challenge has become a global priority.

In light of the close linkage between energy access and poverty alleviation, Sustainable Development Goal 7 was established to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. This is particularly ambitious for Africa, which accounts for three-quarters of the global population without access. However, geospatial electrification planning has emerged as a critical tool to help countries think about how best to provide electricity access to those without it.

Aligned with SDG 7 and with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, the World Bank established the Geospatial Electrification Planning in the Africa Region program to support external client governments and internal task teams in the area of electrification planning for improved policy and decision-making.

### Geospatial Electrification Planning in the Africa Region (GEPAR) is an ESMAP-funded program that aims to:

- Support countries in the execution of geospatial analysis to inform policy, the development of national electrification strategies and plans as well as to provide analytical underpinnings for specific operations (project identification and scoping)
- Improve upon existing geospatial planning approaches by ensuring that demand generated by the agricultural sector is incorporated into the analysis
- Help countries think about evolving priorities, including electrification of health facilities in response to COVID-19, and climate resilience and adaptation
- Build capacity of clients - in the area of electrification planning, rapid infrastructure mapping, and more
