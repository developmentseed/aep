## Scope
Least Cost Geospatial Electrification Analysis ​To Achieve Universal Access In Somaliland

## Description

The Government of Somaliland (GoSL) is engaged in the development of the main policy and legal frameworks necessary for the fulfilment of the ongoing Energy sector reform.​ Under the above function, the government is currently implementing the Somali Electricity Access project (SEAP), supported by the World Bank, which includes the provision of analytical work studies for enabling electrification through solar powered and hybrid mini grids.​
Under this component an indicative least-cost geospatial electrification analysis was prepared by the World Bank to support the work towards universal access to electricity in Somaliland. ​The geospatial electrification planning platform populated with the latest available census data, satellite imagery, consumption estimates as well as capital and operating cost data was used to evaluate expansion options.

The least cost electrification analysis was conducted using the Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool (OnSSET). OnSSET uses geospatial data and other socio-economic parameters to identify the least cost electrification option per settlement. The technologies available in the model are: ​

*Mini-grid systems (PV/Diesel, Wind/Diesel or small-scale hydro)​
*Solar Home Systems (SHS)​
*Grid extension (in some scenarios of our analysis)​

In total, ~20 GIS datasets and ~50 customizable input parameters were used in the model.
