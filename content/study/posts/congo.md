## Scope
This study takes a geospatial least-cost planning approach. The objective of the planning component is to provide a high-level coordinated and optimized vision of the development of access to electricityin  Congo,  taking  into  account  local  renewable  energy  potentials,  off-grid  service,  micro-grids,  and extensions to the national grid, to provide a general overview of the potential required investments under various scenarios.
## Description
The consultant studied three planning scenarios. While theoverall goal of universal or near universal access to electricity by 2030 is common to all three scenarios, the way in which this goal is achieved, as well as the results at the end of the planning period, will vary depending on the assumptions made. IED uses the population of the locality and its distance from the existing grid to determine how each locality will be electrified in each of the scenarios.

### 1. Base Case Scenario: Balanced grid and off-grid expansion
 
- All localities with a population > 250 electrified in 2030: -By grid extension if less than 40 km from the interconnected grid || -By mini decentralized networks if more than 40 km from the interconnected grid
- Pre-electrification  solutions(pico  hydro,  solar  kits...) for  localities with  fewer  than  250 inhabitants to ensure universal access at the end of the planning period

### 2. High Scenario: Accelerated and centralized access

- All localities with a population > 250 electrified in 2030: -By grid extension if less than 80 km from the interconnected grid || -By mini decentralized networks if more than 80 km from the interconnected grid

- Pre-electrification  solutions(pico  hydro,  solar  kits...)    for  localities with  fewer  than  250 inhabitants to ensure universal access at the end of the planning period

### 3. Low Scenario: Decentralised market-driven electrification

- All localities with a population > 500 electrified in 2030: -By grid extension if less than 20 km from the interconnected grid || -By mini decentralized networks if more than 20 km from the interconnected grid
- All localities with a population between 250 and 500 will benefit from a basic energy service provided by pre-electrification solutions (pico hydro, solar kits, etc.)
- Smaller towns with less than 250 inhabitants will not be electrified by 2030
