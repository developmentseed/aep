## Scope
Preparation of a Least-Cost Geospatial Electrification Plan for Grid and Off-Grid Rollout in Zambia
## Description
This study provides a geospatial analysis to identify least-cost electrification options and explores the optimal investment planning to reach universal electrification.
A geospatial least-cost electrification analysis such as the one performed in this study brings together technical realities and static cost assumptions in a techno-economic model. This type of analysis does not attempt to model the complex social, political, and dynamic environment affecting the electricity system.
Therefore, many countries use the results of a geospatial least cost electrification analysis as one input into a broader planning process to develop a national strategy for electrification. Such a strategy serves as a complement to the geospatial analysis to bridge the gap between the results of the technical assessment and the multi-faceted realities of implementation - planning, regulations, financing, project delivery, and monitoring and evaluation - for grid and off-grid electrification efforts. The current study provides a data-driven basis to support national policy decisions by the Government as they prepare their national strategy. For example, the current study does not determine the funding allocation for regions or technologies, nor does it consider the role of pre-electrification. These and many other important questions to be addressed in a national strategy should not be inferred from the results of this study.
## Main Findings
To achieve this ambition, the national electricity access rate must rise by 6 % per year to reach the forecasted 25.3 Million inhabitants in Zambia by 2030. However, the analysis of the 2015-2017 ZESCO annual reports shows that at the current electrification pace 70 thousand customers are being reached on an annual basis, while the target electrification rate to reach Vision 2030 objectives requires a pace of 341 thousand customers per year. Thus, a substantial scale-up of the business as-usual electrification effort is required to succeed in reaching the targets of the National Electrification Program.
Connecting all inhabitants to the electricity grid in 2030 would result in high costs, as the rural areas of the country are sparsely populated. To avoid this undesired high cost for the utility, four different electrification options are defined. Each option offers a certain service Tier (from 0 to 5), denoting the available power capacity, electricity usage and safety, availability, quality and reliability of the power supply, affordability and mean of payment of the electricity service:

1. grid densification: connecting the unelectrified households in localities that are already connected to the grid, providing constant and reliable access and+2 kW power capacities per client, Tier 5;

2. grid extension: extending the electricity grid to reach unconnected localities and new households, providing constant and reliable access and at least 800W power capacity per client, Tier 4-5;

3. mini-grids: installing renewable powered isolated electricity systems to power remote localities, with 24/7 supply, limited outages and 200W power capacity per client, corresponding to Tier 3-4;

4. solar Home Systems (SHS): individual supply systems, to ensure even the most remotely located households are electrified, providing at the minimumlighting and 4 hours of electricity supply, Tier 1.
