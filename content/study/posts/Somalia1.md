## Scope

Preparation of an Indicative Least Cost Geospatial Electrification Plan To Achieve Universal Access In Somalia

## Description

The objective of this study was to provide an indicative least-cost geospatial electrification plan to support the work towards universal access to electricity in Somalia. 
The analysis has been structured to reflect the Power Master Plan and the Governmentâ€™s sector priorities for regional and  national  development  through  2030  and  generate  indicative  investment  financing requirements for the next five years (2020-2025) along with approximate requirements through 2030. 
The geospatial electrification analysis was undertaken to examine different options for electrification  in  Somalia  through  to  2030,  to  provide  the  necessary  data  to  support  robust decision-making  in  the  Somali  electricity  sector. 

A   geospatial   electrification   analysis   was   carriedout   using   the   Open   Source   Spatial Electrification  Tool  (OnSSET)  to  help  identify  least-cost  electrification  options  for  increased access  to  electricity  in  Somalia.  OnSSET  identifies  the  least-cost  electricity  technology-configuration  to  accomplish  access for  all  settlements  in  a  country  drawing  on  a  set  of geospatial, demographic and techno-economic data. The methodology can be briefly divided into three steps:
1. Identification of settlements and priority service delivery facilities
2. Demand estimation: hree  demand  scenarios  were  developed  for  the residential demand; one low, one medium and one high demand based on information on current demand collected from ESPs and household targets from the Power Master Plan.
3. Comparison  of  electricity  supply  options
