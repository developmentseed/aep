## Scope

The World Bank awarded the National Electrification Analysis (NEA) project to NRECA International (NRECA) in November 2019. The  terms of reference of the NEA project require an analysis  of multiple electrification access options to be presented to the Government of Liberia (GoL) as it prepares the National Electrification Strategy (NES) for Liberia. 

## Description

The principal objective of the NEA project is to prepare a framework to support increased access to electric service by accelerating the pace, lowering the cost, and increasing the impact of investment, infrastructure construction, and connections. The NRECA team will focus on five principal tasks for this assignment:
* Task 1: Review of background documents and assessment of current electrification efforts
* Task 2: Assessment  of service quality levels and least-cost technology schemes for electrification
* Task 3: Identification of potential least-cost technology options for electrification
* Task 4: Suitable options and arrangements for scaling up electrification
* Task 5: Dissemination of information – consultations, and workshops

Task 3 of the Liberia NEA, identification of potential least-cost technology options for electrification, is designed as a least-cost geospatial planning analysis that will identify potential design options addressing nationwide electrification - via grid expansion, isolated networks and standalone systems - over the term 2020-2030. The geospatial platform was used to identify a series of grid and off-grid project options that will be evaluated taking into consideration likely implementation schedules, financing requirements and the capacity of LEC and private off-grid service providers to implement these projects. Adjustments were made to balance grid and off-grid investment programs – especially taking into consideration the power supply issues, affordability and the ability of the public and private sector resources to finance the investments.

## Main findings

Achieving full access by 2030 will be quite challenging but targets for electrification access programs should be set high. Funding commitments for grid densification and expansion budgets already total over $200 million but approximately $120 million in additional funding10 is needed to finance the remaining investment through 2030. Significant progress will need to be made to support off-grid electrification of health facilities and schools as noted earlier in this document. The greatest challenge will likely be to build professional capabilities in MLME, RREA, NEP and the private sector to manage the extraordinary expansion of service that will be required in an effective and affordable manner.
